Script to Compare Data Extracted from an Excel File with Data from a Database.

The spreadsheet is the result of a query to the database, so it has columns belonging to the table of interest. Its data has been updated and verified by specialized personnel.

In the database, the data from the Excel file should be reflected. Due to the large volume, I created this script to compare the data between the two sources, display those that are different, and update those that the user requires.

The script will first save a backup in CSV format of the database data.
